We have developed a low-cost healthcare model which has successfully improved the health of children and families, and reduced mortality rates, in many countries around the world.
We want children to survive preventable diseases and malnutrition. We want all mothers and newborns to have proper care before, during and after birth. And we believe girls and women should have access to information on their reproductive rights and the dangers of early marriage.
