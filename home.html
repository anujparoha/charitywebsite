   <h1> Better health for girls, boys, families and communities</h1>
   <p>
For many children around the world, the difference between life and death comes down to access to basic healthcare. Yet healthcare is a fundamental right of children everywhere.

We want children to survive preventable diseases and malnutrition. We want all mothers and newborns to have proper care before, during and after birth. And we believe girls and women should have access to information on their reproductive rights and the dangers of early marriage.

We have developed a low-cost healthcare model which has successfully improved the health of children and families, and reduced mortality rates, in many countries around the world.

We invest in addressing how girls and women access healthcare and break down the barriers to health created because of their gender. We focus on the huge impact clean water and good sanitation can have on the health of a community.
